** You should include the code book describing the variables.

** List of datasets created by the script:
"colheads"			- the column headers fro the measurements      
"dat_tot"       	- the test, training datasets joined with the subject and activity (10299 x 563)
"datmean"       	- the mean variables selected from dat_tot
"datstd"        	- the std variables selected from data_tot
"features"     		- the downloaded 'features.txt' file
"meanstd"       	- the mean and std data joined from dat_tot
"meansummary"   	- the final summary of all the grouped averages
"subject_test"  	- list of test subjects 
"subject_train" 	- list of training subjects
"test"         		- the test data with subject and activiy columns
"train"         	- the train data with subject and activiy columns
"x_test"        	- data from the downloaded 'X_test.txt' file
"x_train"       	- data from the downloaded 'x_train.txt' file
"y_test"        	- data from the downloaded 'y_test.txt' file
"y_train"			- data from the downloaded 'y_train.txt' file

The final uploaded 'tidydata.txt' file was created with
			write.table() using row.name=FALSE and separator /t
